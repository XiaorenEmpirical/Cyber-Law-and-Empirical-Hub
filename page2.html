    <h1>Welcome to Empirical Law Summer Workshop 2025 (online) </h1>
    
    <p> Topic: The legal challenges of metaverse-facilitated crime </p>
    <p> Time: 12th May, 2025, 3pm-4pm (UK time) </p>
    <p> Speaker: Dr Lorenzo Pasculli </p>
    
    <p> Abstract: The metaverse is a convergence of technologies (e.g. virtual and mixed reality devices and haptic suites) that enables the hybridisation of physical and virtual environments. While there are many legitimate uses for the metaverse, recent cases and research suggest that it is likely to enable new criminal opportunities and reshape traditional crimes into new forms. Examples includes new social engineering schemes for fraud, damages or theft of virtual assets and currencies, cyber-physical harassment and stalking, sexual assaults through haptic devices, child abuse and child grooming exploiting the alluring and immersive nature of metaverse spaces, crimes against avatars. As our awareness of our threats increase, many questions concerning the suitability of existing legal frameworks to adequately address such emerging threats arise. These concern not only criminal law and justice, but also the regulation of relevant sectors of industry and technologies. Are existing offences sufficient to enable the prosecution of metaverse-facilitated harms? Do online safety laws in different jurisdictions adequately address the risks of metaverse-facilitated crime? Can these laws have any unintended consequences? Are avatars and virtual assets adequately protected by the law? This presentation will provide some preliminary insights on these problems based on research conducted at the UCL Dawes Centre for Future Crime on metaverse-facilitated crime and related legal frameworks.  </p>

<details><summary> Effectiveness of Website Blocking Injunctions and Counterfeit Goods: An Empirical Research Study of Blocking Orders Issued by the English and Scottish Courts, by Zoi Krokida and Xiaoren Wang </summary>
<br>Website blocking injunctions are court orders that require Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to block access to websites hosting infringing content. In the UK, these injunctions seem to provide an important tool in combating online infringement, particularly copyright and trade mark violations. However, there is limited empirical research on difficulties in obtaining these injunctions and the factors that influence their success or rejection. In order to address these gaps, this research project seeks to meticulously examine around 200 injunctions issued by the English and Scottish Courts from 2010 to 2024. Through systematic coding and regression analysis, the study will identify patterns and disparities in the outcomes of these orders—whether granted or dismissed—and explore the factors that impact their acceptance or rejection. Furthermore, the research will identify potential trends in the order of website blocking injunctions over time, revealing how they have evolved during the 14-year period. Additionally, this research will also interview stakeholders on their practical difficulties in obtaining a successful blocking injunction and its enforcement. In this light, the findings will offer precious empirical evidence and craft policy recommendations that will inform policy debates, legislators and courts.<br><br>
